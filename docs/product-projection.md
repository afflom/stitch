# Complete Stitch product projection

## What is represented

`app/src/Product/Model.lex.tex` is the project-owned typed product graph. Its
`product` value contains the component, capability, external-assumption,
dependency, deployment and artifact declarations listed in
`product/contracts.json`. `valid` checks identity uniqueness, component-to-asset
closure, capability ownership and assumption closure, dependency consumers and
deployment capability references. `productGraphIsClosed` states the concrete
structural acceptance obligation. The register is derived from these declarations; its counts are not policy
scores, reliability measurements or limits on extension.

The graph covers all five Stitch layers and the actual browser product:

- Canonical objects, encodings, XOR fragments, local cache, conditional peer
  custody, migrations and recovery.
- Experimental scheduling proposals under independent resource admission.
- Deterministic programs, checkpoint replay, transfer and resumption.
- Independently pinned pointer authority, full pointer DNS serialization,
  DoH reads and scoped DNS writes.
- Browser DOM, WebCrypto, elapsed and wall clocks, session RAM, WebRTC,
  same-origin BroadcastChannel and public signaling.
- Separately enabled public payload relay and its disclosure boundary.
- v86, WebAssembly, BIOS, Linux guest image, 9p object-file mirroring, shell
  output and Ethernet forwarding.
- Same-origin static publication and every currently loaded local asset.
- Historical simulation/Rust conformance, distinguished from the live product.
- Native Linux routing as an explicitly unsupported browser boundary.

`Product.Host` defines typed requests, destination/content/session-bound grants,
pending effects and matching terminal host observations. Admission reserves the
existing action-ID budget ledger before appending a pending request. Pending
requests do not create observations. Observation binding checks the action ID,
capability, subject, destination, session and non-regressing observation time.
Repeated or wrong-session completions are refused; recording a success, failure
or unknown outcome never refunds the ledger. These are pure contracts, not a
new browser driver or a claim the handwritten runtime already implements this
entire journal. Domain acceptance remains necessary after a host response.

The host contract does not accept an arbitrary boolean as proof of storage,
cryptography, propagation, guest execution or retention. Its authorization flag
is an externally supplied grant observation with an explicit exact scope. The
host is responsible for obtaining that grant, serializing transitions and
retaining its journal. A source theorem cannot authenticate a host assertion.

## Tested host-transition correspondence

The implementation uses existing component state rather than a second generic
budget or journal. Focused interruption tests now exercise these refinements:

- Transport fences signaling, ICE, sockets, peer replacement and data-channel
  callbacks with exact channel and generation identity. Switching or reconnecting
  a mesh invalidates old asynchronous work before cleanup.
- DNS publication retains destination/pinned-authority-scoped candidates and
  provider record identity. Bounded exact reads precede writes. An uncertain
  create or update permits reconciliation reads, not a blind repeat; signed
  matching content confirms the observed result. Tokens are not retained in
  publication state. Provider acknowledgement is neither DNS propagation nor
  atomic compare-and-swap.
- VM startup has constructor/download/readiness failure transitions and a
  configurable finite deadline (60 seconds by default). Cleanup permits explicit
  retry, and generation identity fences old callbacks. Cleanup is best-effort,
  not proof that host downloads stopped. A command timeout means its completion
  is unknown, not that the command was cancelled. Whole-VM runtime expiry and
  explicit cancellation after dispatch separately request a stop; local-9p
  pre-allocation limits and bounded range reads are installed before run. The
  retained-command selector can observe earlier available handles without replay.
- `Stitch.Pointer.restoreAllowed` admits only a separately accepted exact vault
  anchor in its independently pinned live scope, with current signature/validity
  and an empty or identical retained head. `PointerObserver` shares restoration
  and succession's serialized CAS; no different retained head can be overwritten.
  `Product.Experience` separately exposes import, exact acceptance and explicit
  restoration, with checked/accepted/live-head evidence and busy/scope guards.
  The branded vault read, cryptographic result, clock and DOM facts remain host
  observations; no imported evidence automatically establishes trust.
- Serialized storage/compute ingress, immutable reservations, retained pointer
  heads and explicit resource-epoch renewal implement their corresponding local
  admission boundaries. Unknown effects do not refund previous charges.

`tests/transport-generation.test.js`, `tests/dns-publication.test.js`,
`tests/vm-lifecycle.test.js`, `tests/pointer-recovery.test.js`, recovery UI tests and the browser-script harness in
`tests/runtime-admission.test.js` cover these concrete paths. They do not prove
universal runtime refinement of `Product.Host`, physical browser/NAT behavior,
or the host's cryptographic/grant attestations. The full contract's typed grant
roots and complete terminal-observation journal remain specification boundaries,
not claims about mechanisms absent from the runtime.

## Official Prism representation and the supported route

The official `Foundation.Arch` facet represents the complete component and flow
view through `app/src/Product/Architecture.lex.tex`: 18 components, 31 directed
flows, four stakeholder groups (operator, reader, reviewer and system integrator),
four concerns, and four corresponding viewpoints and views. All
indexes are derived contiguous positions in sorted declaration-identifier order.
There are no invented quality scores, thresholds or measured availability rows.

The original architecture-only type subset was derived from the official
[PrismPM Foundation.Arch source](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/PrismPM/blob/fe5b8b73a94134c316329a8d1b09ebc97b555c5f/stdlib/src/Foundation/Arch.lex.tex).
The complete product facets extend those types with the pinned
[UORust type source](https://github.com/afflom/UORust/tree/1d531dfe0120d1cbdac2dd599f6cde513118f0ce/app/src),
including the design-view types and related security, quality, threat-model and
experience records. Exact upstream source hashes, derived type-file hashes,
retained declaration counts and derivation scope are recorded in
[`product/facet-type-provenance.json`](../product/facet-type-provenance.json).
The old architecture-source hash is historical provenance, not the identity of
the expanded current type file.

These are type-only declarations: examples, instances and upstream proof claims
are not copied as acceptance evidence. Titles use available glossary terms.
Qualified type names remain intact; the SDK projection mapping is unchanged.
The original PrismPM MIT notice remains in `product/PRISMPM-LICENSE-MIT.txt` and
UORust notices in `product/UORUST-LICENSE-MIT.txt`. The application still uses its
existing digest-pinned SDK. Type-reference inspection neither upgrades that SDK
nor claims the expanded source has passed its formal gate.

The official
[specification sections 2 and 11](https://github.com/UOR-Foundation/PrismPM/blob/fe5b8b73a94134c316329a8d1b09ebc97b555c5f/SPEC.md)
explain the limit of the currently supported containing-system profiles:

- `prismpm/system-model/2` is a static generated DOM/WebAssembly browser
  application with **no persistent storage and no external application
  services**. The specification explicitly says empty Holo capabilities do not
  admit browser-effect requirements. It cannot truthfully contain full Stitch.
- `system-model/1` is the transactional production-service profile, not an
  arbitrary browser product graph.
- `system-model/3` is a separate host-effect server service with loopback-only
  Linux/Compose deployment. It is not a WebRTC browser profile and does not
  automatically supply whole-product release/replay or deployment acceptance.

Accordingly, the supported implementation is the project-owned complete typed
product contract plus the official architecture facet projection, with the
existing pure `StitchApp` as the selected TextApplication conformance probe.
No field claims a browser capability grant, and no custom `system-model` JSON
or fabricated product release is introduced. The probe's kernel/artifact
acceptance, when actually obtained, covers that selected pure core and its
stated source obligations, **not the complete live browser implementation**.

## Exact local assets, dependencies and unresolved provenance

`product/contracts.json` is an application-owned contract register, not an
SDK input schema, Holo, signed attestation, build receipt or certificate.
`scripts/check-product.mjs` reads closed literal rows from the model and binds
all formal source, local vocabulary/configuration, SDK and npm locks, and the
exact byte length/SHA-256 of every declared local product asset. It checks
cross-reference closure and refuses omitted browser assets. It does not compile
LexLean or prove the runtime implements a contract.

The inventory records existing v86 JavaScript/Wasm, SeaBIOS, VGA BIOS and Linux
image bytes. [The provenance review](vendor-provenance.md) establishes official
v86 distribution identity, actual JavaScript reconstruction and complete
applicable notices, plus the BIOS origin and corresponding source/configuration.
The four resolved assets require their accompanying `vendor/v86` or
`vendor/seabios` materials in distributions. `vendor/distribution.json` binds the
reviewed asset and companion bytes; the existing product-register check refuses
changed assets or missing/substituted required materials.
The adopted Linux 6.18.7 guest has a verified immutable source-distribution tree,
linked by `vendor/guest/SOURCE-NOTICE.md`. `vendorDistributionMaterialsRecorded`
states the model register now records accompanying materials for every asset;
it is not a legal conclusion, remote-availability proof or native SDK acceptance.
Independent byte-identical compiler reconstruction is useful evidence, not a
new licensing condition for every asset.
An asset digest proves identity of the inventoried local bytes, not ownership,
license, security or that a remote static host served those bytes. The current
browser does not verify every dependency against this inventory at load time.
A production redistribution release needs the original source/license notices
and provenance review for each vendor artifact.

External dependencies are API/host trust boundaries rather than fictional
immutable hashes: browser APIs, Cloudflare DoH/API, Google/Cloudflare STUN,
public ntfy signaling and optional cache, and the selected static origin.
Cloudflare tokens are secret references only; no token value belongs in the
model, inventory, evidence or repository. A provider's current availability,
API policy, DNS propagation or peer retention needs independent observation.

## Deployment and lifecycle contracts

The browser deployment is an ordinary same-origin static product, with the
complete local asset set and explicitly enabled network functions. A valid
static publication is not a successful browser readiness test. Probe-only
publication cannot replace the multi-panel Stitch UI. Rollback retains an
entire prior asset set. Reloading loses RAM, session-local budget state and
unpersisted trusted anchors. Explicitly saved origin-local signing keys and
publication journals survive an ordinary reload when browser storage remains
available; that is not an eviction-proof backup or persistent object-custody
guarantee. Unknown provider outcomes remain unresolved until reconciled.

VM memory sizes and request ceilings already in the implementation are host
configuration, not derived kernel guarantees. VM boot/shell/Ethernet operations
are outside deterministic ring-job semantics and its compute-work accounting.
DNS provider acknowledgement is not resolver-wide freshness. A timeout is a
local observation, not peer death. Different peer identifiers are not evidence
of independent failure domains. Public signaling/relay topics are not access
controls, and sufficient relayed fragments reveal the object.

## Reproduce and evaluate

After an intentional model, runtime or configuration edit:

```sh
node scripts/check-product.mjs --write
node scripts/check-product.mjs --check
node --test tests/product-model.test.js
```

Review register diffs alongside the source changes. The checks cover stale
source/asset hashes, unknown capability owners and assumptions, missing assets,
unknown deployment capabilities, dangling architecture flows, noncanonical
indexes, relay opt-in removal, unsupported browser routing claims, literal
substitution and changed vendor bytes. Mutation tests do not establish network,
VM, browser or cryptographic correctness.

The sorted LexLean entrypoints include the original Product modules and all nine
generated facets in the same source graph as the domain and probe.
Run canonical formatting, source locking, LexLean check, Lean/leanchecker with
actual exact observed axiom policies, and the pinned PrismPM gate. Report each
stage separately. Neither the generated register nor `lexlean check` is a Lean
proof result; real kernel acceptance is distinct from full Prism artifact and
oracle acceptance. No external hosted verifier upload is required or authorized
by this documentation.
